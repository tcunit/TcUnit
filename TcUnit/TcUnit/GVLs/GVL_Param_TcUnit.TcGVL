    (* TcUnit logs complete test results. These include:

         - Number of successful tests
         - Number of failed tests
         - Any eventual failed assertion (with the expected & actual value plus an user defined message)
       These are all printed to the ADS logger (Visual Studio error list) marked with ERROR criticality

       On top of this TcUnit also reports some statistics/extended information with HINT/INFO criticality.
       These statistics are more detailed results of the tests. This information is used when results are
       being collected by an external software (such as TcUnit-Runner) to do for example Jenkins integration.
       This extra information however takes time to print, so by setting the following parameter to FALSE
       it will speed up TcUnit finishing. *)

       2000 it means that TcUnit will consume around 1 MB of router memory. *)
